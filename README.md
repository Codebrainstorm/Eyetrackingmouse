# Eyetrackingmouse
An assistive technology project that allows users to control the mouse cursor using their eye movements. This system leverages computer vision techniques to track the user's gaze and translates it into cursor movement, enabling hands-free interaction with a computer

# How It Works
The webcam captures your face and detects eyes using facial landmarks.
Eye position is mapped to the screen for cursor movement.
Blink detection is used as a mouse click.
Left blink → Left Click
Right blink / double blink → Right Click
